				<h4>What is an adverse action?</h4>
				<p>An adverse action is a notice given to you by the lending company which gives you a reason for being denied a loan or credit. No need to worry if you’ve received one of these, lenders send them to explain why you weren’t pre-qualified. </p>
				<h4>Why did I receive this?</h4>
				<p>Due to FCRA (Fair Credit Reporting Act) all lending companies have to let you know why you weren’t qualified.  The notice has to be given orally, written, or in an electronic format. You can get an Adverse Action if you need to increase your credit score, send in an incomplete application, or have a limited credit history. By law a company must notify you within 30 days of receiving a credit application. </p>
				<h4>I was rejected, now what?</h4>
				<p>The lender looks at multiple factors to determine the eligibility of a borrower. If you haven’t approved it is not the end of the road. You also might consider credit unions, banks, or other online lending companies. You can also get in contact with the credit bureau the lender used and request a free copy of your credit report. It is best to look over your credit reports for any discrepancies and dispute errors with the bureau.</p>
